# Launching-Pad

This is a website I created as one of the projects assigned by "The Odin Project". I replicated the template given me segment by segment going from top to bottom. After that, I changed the HTML and decided to make it a website page introducing a character from one of my favorite anime when I was a child. 

This website demonstrates my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and my knowledge of using flexbox to design the page.
